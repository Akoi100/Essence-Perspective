## Brand Tone & Aesthetic
- **Voice:** Minimal. Cinematic. Premium. Calm. Reflective. Not loud. Not cluttered.
- **Audience:** Ambitious young professionals and creatives who value intentional living, travel, and meaningful visual storytelling.
- **Design Direction:**
  - Clean layout with strong spacing and generous white space
  - Large, full-bleed cinematic aerial visuals
  - Neutral color palette: black, beige, and soft white only
  - Elegant, editorial typography (NOT generic fonts like Inter, Roboto, or Arial — use distinctive serif or refined display fonts)
  - Mobile-first, fully responsive
  - No autoplay audio
  - No excessive or distracting animations — subtle, intentional motion only

## Page Structure & Copy

### 1. HERO SECTION
